RF AC (Roblox Forum Activity Count) lets you see up-to-date activity on Roblox Forum with next to no delay. Entirely made in Python as a small project to have fun making : )

# Installation
You are required to have latest version of Python installed. https://www.python.org/downloads/
After you downloaded Python, download the latest release of the program, to do that on the right side of the screen, click on the latest release, then Source Corde (zip). That should download the source code for you.
Make sure you put the folder somewhere easy to access. You will need to open command prompt and use CD command to get yourself to the folder. To make it easy for you, type in
```
cd
```
And after that, put the folder in the command prompt and press enter, you should be now in the directory of the folder.
Then, in the command prompt type the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Wait while all the necessary libraries are being downloaded. After all of them are downloaded, you can use either of the 2 builds.
New build features more colorful display, and makes the program more optimized (faster). Released as of 19.12.2021 (DD/MM/YY)
Old build is old build. Released as of 11.11.2021 (DD/MM/YY)
When you choose one of them, enter the folder and launch trackbot.py and afterwards you are free to go!
