# RF-Activity-Count
RF AC lets you see up-to-date activity on Roblox Forum. It's that simple.

# Installation
You are required to have latest version of Python installed. https://www.python.org/downloads/
After you downloaded Python, download the latest release of the program.
Make sure you put the folder somewhere easy to access. You will need to open command prompt and use CD command to get yourself to the folder. To make it easy for you, type in
```
cd
```
And after that, put the folder in the command prompt and press enter, you should be now in the directory of the folder.
Then, in the command prompt type the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Wait while all the necessary libraries are being downloaded. After all of them are downloaded, you are free to launch the program.

If there are any issues, create an issue or contact me on Discord. Matieo33#5352
